        <p>When you're in need of a quick and easy dinner that the whole family will love, look no further than pork chops. This 5-star grilled pork chop recipe has reviewers' mouths watering thanks to the spectacular honey-garlic glaze — but the 25-minute fridge-to-table time is also a perk too.</p>

        <div>Ingrediants</div>

        <ul>
            <div class="instructions">
                <li>½ cup ketchup</li>
                <li>2 ⅔ tablespoons honey</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
                <li>6 (4 ounce) (1-inch thick) pork chops</li>
            </div>    
        </ul>

        <div>Directions</div>
        <ol>
            <div class="instructions">
                <li>Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
                <li>Whisk ketchup, honey, soy sauce, and garlic together in a bowl to make a glaze.</li>
                <li>Sear the pork chops on both sides on the preheated grill. Lightly brush glaze onto each side of the chops as they cook; grill until no longer pink in the center, about 7 to 9 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</li>
